# FoodOrderApp---React
This is a food delivery app that was created with the help of the instructions of Maximillian from his course on Udemy on React.js. The app collects the information of the food that the user orders and creates a cart for that session that can be ordered later. 
The cart keeps a count of the items and the total amount allowing dyncamic changes as well.
